title: Source & Vortex Panel Analysis
description:  Developed a MATLAB solver for the numerical source/vortex panel method based on equations from Andersonâ€™s book. The source panel method approximates the flow around an object using discrete panels, while the added vortex approximates circulation, which are essential for modeling nonlinear geometries.
Skills: 
- MATLAB
- Source/vortex panel methods
- Modeled flow fields
- Ground effects
- Streamline and velocity contour
- Aerodynamic performance
- Thin airfoil theory
