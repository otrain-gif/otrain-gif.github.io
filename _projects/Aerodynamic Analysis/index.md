title: Aerodynamic Analysis
description:  Conducted experiments on vortex shedding, wake behavior, boundary layers, and airfoil performance using a subsonic wind tunnel. Measured cylinder oscillations with an accelerometer to analyze vortex shedding frequency vs. velocity. Used pitot-static tubes to map velocity profiles in wakes and boundary layers. Tested an airfoil at varying angles of attack, observing stall around 12Â° and improved post-stall performance under turbulent flow. Results validated fluid mechanics principles and highlighted their applications in aerospace design and turbine optimization
