title: Schlieren Imaging
description:  Calibrated a blowdown supersonic wind tunnel using pressure transducers, pitot probes, and Schlieren imaging. Determined Mach number in the test section via isentropic relations, Rayleigh pitot tube equations, and Schlieren analysis. Verified the tunnelâ€™s ability to produce Mach numbers up to ~3 and analyzed discrepancies between theory and experiment due to shocks, turbulence, and instrumentation limits. Conducted uncertainty analysis on pressure measurements to evaluate the reliability of Mach number calculations. Demonstrated shock wave visualization and flow deflection effects using optical Schlieren techniques.
