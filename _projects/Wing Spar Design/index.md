title: Wing Spar Design
description:  Designed and optimized an I-beam wing spar to withstand specified aerodynamic loads while minimizing weight. Applied stress and deflection analysis under bending and shear loads to ensure structural integrity. Incorporated fatigue life estimation using the Palmgrenâ€“Miner rule. Used MMPDS material data to evaluate trade-offs between strength, stiffness, and density. Produced an optimized geometry that satisfied strength, fatigue, and weight constraints, demonstrating principles of aerospace structural design
