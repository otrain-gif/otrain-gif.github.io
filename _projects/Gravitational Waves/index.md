title: Gravitational Waves and Their Potential on the Moon
Description:  I researched how gravitational waves are observed and the opportunities and limitations of lunar gravitational wave detection. Although there are already multiple laser interferometer gravitational-wave observatories on Earth, the Earth is limited in detecting a specific frequency range. These machines require a multitude of complex stabilizers and ideal conditions to mitigate noise sources like air currents and ground motion, so they can be more sensitive to gravitational waves.

  - Gravitational Wave Physics
  - Noise Modeling
  - Systems Engineering
  - Astrophysics & Space Systems
  - Scientific Communication
